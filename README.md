# Neural-Networks-Music-Genres

With the music industry creating a tremendous amount of new data daily, as well as offering
plentiful business opportunities via an enormous total addressable market, machine learning
techniques provide an opportunity to accelerate the digital transformation of streaming and
online services. This paper addresses how Mel Spectrograms and Convolutional Neural
Network (Convnet) models provide exceptional performance in multi-class classification of short
audio clips of music recordings spanning ten different genres. In experiments I am able to
achieve 88.5% Test Accuracy with convolutional neural network techniques. This research
represents an important first step towards organizing and optimizing online music catalogs
through genre classification and building effective music recommendation engines for todayâ€™s
online listeners
